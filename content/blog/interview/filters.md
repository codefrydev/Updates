## What do you understand by filters in MVC?

> Filters are components that enable developers to inject logic into the request processing pipeline at various stages.

>Filters are used to perform tasks such as logging, authentication, authorization, exception handling, caching, and more.

> Filters provide a way to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns.

> Filters can be applied globally to the entire application or selectively to specific controllers or action methods.

There are several types of filters in ASP.NET MVC:

1. **Authentication Filters:**
   > Implement the `IAuthenticationFilter` interface and are executed during the authentication phase of the request processing. They can be used to perform tasks related to user authentication.

2. **Authorization Filters:**
   > Implement the `IAuthorizationFilter` interface and are responsible for checking whether the current user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. They run after authentication and before the action method execution.

3. **Action Filters:**
   > Implement the `IActionFilter` interface and are used to inject logic before and after the execution of an action method. They include methods like `OnActionExecuting` (executed before the action method) and `OnActionExecuted` (executed after the action method).

4. **Result Filters:**
   > Implement the `IResultFilter` interface and are executed before and after the ActionResult is executed. They include methods like `OnResultExecuting` (executed before the result is executed) and `OnResultExecuted` (executed after the result is executed).

5. **Exception Filters:**

   > Implement the `IExceptionFilter` interface and are responsible for handling exceptions that occur during the processing of a request. They include methods like `OnException`, which is executed when an unhandled exception occurs.

#### Here's an example of using an action filter in ASP.NET MVC

```csharp
public class CustomActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        // Logic to be executed before the action method
    }

    public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
    {
        // Logic to be executed after the action method
    }
}
```

#### we can then apply this filter to a controller or action method using the `[CustomActionFilter]` attribute

```csharp
[CustomAuthenticationFilter]
[CustomAuthorizationFilter]
[CustomActionFilter]
public class MyController : Controller
{
    [CustomActionFilter]
    [CustomResultFilter]
    public ActionResult MyAction()
    {
        // Action method logic
        return View();
    }
}
```

## What is the function of beforeRender() in the controller?

> This function is required when we call render() manually before the end of a given action. This function is called before the view is rendered and after controller action logic. It is not used often.

## What do we know about beforeFilter() and afterFilter() functions in controllers?

> In the context of ASP.NET MVC, there is no specific `beforeFilter` or `afterFilter` method in controllers.

> In ASP.NET MVC, we can achieve via action filters.

**Before Action Filter:**

> In ASP.NET MVC, we can use action filters like `OnActionExecuting` to perform tasks before the action method is executed.

> This is similar to a "before filter" concept. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class MyActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
{
   public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
   {
         // Pre-processing logic before the action method
   }
}
```

**After Action Filter:**
> For post-processing tasks after the action method is executed, we
 can use `OnActionExecuted`.

> This is similar to an "after filter" concept:

```csharp
public class MyActionFilter : ActionFilterAttribute
{
   public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
   {
         // Post-processing logic after the action method
   }
}
```

> Applying filter

```csharp
[MyActionFilter]
public class MyController : Controller
{
   public ActionResult MyAction()
   {
         // Main action logic
         return View();
   }
}
```
