## Assembly Overview

- Assembly is unit of deployment like EXE or a DLL
- When you create a code and build the solution, then the .NET
Framework convert your code into Intermediate Language and
that is placed inside the assembly(dll), which you can find
inside bin folder

- **Assembly:** A compiled code library in .NET that contains types, resources, and metadata.
- **Types of Assemblies:** Executable (EXE) and Library (DLL).
- **Components:** Manifest, metadata, IL code, and resources.
- **Strong Naming:** Ensures assembly uniqueness and integrity.
- **Global Assembly Cache (GAC):** Stores shared assemblies across applications.
