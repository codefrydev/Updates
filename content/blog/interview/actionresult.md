## What is the difference between ‘ViewResult’ and ‘ActionResult’?

In ASP.NET MVC, both `ViewResult` and `ActionResult` are classes that represent the result of an action method. The primary difference between them lies in their level of abstraction.

1. **ActionResult:**
   > `ActionResult` is the base class for all action results in ASP.NET MVC. It provides a high level of abstraction, allowing action methods to return various types of results, such as `ViewResult`, `RedirectResult`, `JsonResult`, etc.

   > When we define an action method, we can use `ActionResult` as the return type, providing flexibility to return different types of results based on the specific requirements of our action.

   > Example:

     ```csharp
     public ActionResult MyAction()
     {
         // ... logic ...
         return View(); // Returning a ViewResult
     }
     ```

2. **ViewResult:**
   > `ViewResult` is a derived class of `ActionResult` specifically designed for returning a view from an action method. It represents the result of rendering a view.

   > When we want an action method to render a view, we can use `ViewResult` as the return type. This class allows we to set properties related to the view, such as the view name, model, and view data.

   > Example:

     ```csharp
     public ViewResult MyViewAction()
     {
         // ... logic ...
         return View("MyView", myModel); // Returning a ViewResult with view name and model
     }
     ```

> `ActionResult` is a more general type that allows we to return various types of results.

> `ViewResult` provides a bit more clarity in our code when we specifically want to indicate that our action method is rendering a view.
